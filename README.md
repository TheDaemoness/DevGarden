A versatile and modern IDE for versatile and modern people.

Developed with support from the members of the community at #cplusplus.com on Freenode.

This is a multi-language IDE that defers building to a traditionally IDE-agnostic build system of the user's choice.
It can autogenerate build files, or simply be used as an editor if the user prefers.
It also features a number of usability features that I have not generally seen in other IDEs.

## Dependencies:
* A (mostly) C++14-compliant compiler. DevGarden supports clang 3.5 and g++ 4.9.2.
* Qt 5.2 or later.
* cmake 3.1 or later.
* ruby 2.0 or later.
