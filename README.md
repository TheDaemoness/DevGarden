# DevGarden
A versatile and modern IDE for versatile and modern people.

Developed by members of the community at #cplusplus.com on Freenode.

This is an IDE that defers building to a traditionally IDE-agnostic build system of the user's choice.
It can autogenerate build files, or simply be used as an editor if the user prefers.

More details to come.

Dependencies:
* A (mostly) C++11-compliant compiler.
* Qt 5.x
